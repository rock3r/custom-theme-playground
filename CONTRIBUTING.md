Contributions are welcome!

Please provide your contributions in the form of PRs.

When creating a PR, please avoid putting multiple separate fixes in a single PR; if possible, prefer separate PRs for each individual fix.

This makes it easier to merge non-controversial ones, and discuss other PRs without creating a cacophony of unrelated comments in the same PR.

Thanks in advance for your contributions!
